# Introduction to geospatial Python

This is an adaptation of the University of Helsinki's [Automating GIS processes course] (https://autogis-site.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) for the 3-day intensive course at CSC (Introduction to geospatial Python). 

Instructor: Kamyar Hasanzadeh, PhD (2024)



# Contents and topics of the course:

This course teaches you how to do different geospatial related tasks in Python programming language. Each lesson is a tutorial with specific topic(s) where the aim is to learn how to solve common GIS-related problems and tasks using open-source Python tools. In the lessons we use only publicly available data which can be used and downloaded by anyone anywhere. 

### Topics of the course:

* GIS in Python; Spatial Data Model, Geometric Objects, Shapely
* Working with (Geo)DataFrames
* Geocoding and spatial queries
* Geometric operations, reclassifying data
* Visualization, static and interactive maps
* OSM data aquisition and simple network analysis
* Raster data processing in Python

Prerequisities
--------------

Basics of geoinformatics and Python; no earlier experience with Python GIS packages is needed.

If you need to refresh your Python skills you can go through the materials of Helsinki University's [GeoPython](https://geo-python-site.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) course.

## Browser based programming environment

The instructions in this course provide a programming environment that allows
anyone to immediately try and run all sample code directly in the browser. This
functionality is realised using [Binder](https://mybinder.org/) and the
[CSC](https://csc.fi/)â€™s [Notebooks](https://notebooks.csc.fi/) (the latter are
available to students and staff at Finnish universities, only).
